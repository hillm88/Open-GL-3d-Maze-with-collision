# Open-GL-3d-Maze-with-collision

This is a assignment I did in Open GL where I made a maze with collision that you can toggle on and off, and wireframing so that you can see where the red cubes you are supposed to locate are. It was coded in c++.

To toggle wireframing on and off, use the o key.
To enable or disable collisions, use the w key.
